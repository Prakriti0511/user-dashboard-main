I have performed the task and deployed it using Github.

Objective: Create a user dashboard that fetches and displays user data from a REST API. The dashboard should include basic user information and a list of user activities. This question will assess your skills in React.js, and REST API integration.

Requirements:

1. Setup:
a. Initialize a new React project.
b. Fetch data from a mock REST API endpoint (you can use a public API like
jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users for user data and jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts for user activities).

2. Components:
a. Create a UserProfile component that displays the user's basic information (e.g., name, email, phone).
b. Create a UserActivities component that displays a list of user activities (e.g., posts).

3. Design:
a. Use HTML and CSS to style your components.
b. Ensure the design is user-friendly and responsive.

4. Functionality:
a. Fetch user data and user activities from the API.
b. Display user data in the UserProfile component.
c. Display a list of user activities in the UserActivities component.
d. Implement loading states and error handling for data fetching.

5. Bonus:
a. Use TypeScript to define the types of user data and activities.
b. Implement basic routing to navigate between different users (e.g., /users/1,/users/2).
